#About this repo

This project, code named rare-candy (a reference to an item used to level up and possibly evolve a Pokemon), is an experiment in building a project with flexibly defined CSS rules. Upon loading the project, you will notice that the styles change or 'evolve' with each load. New styles can be randomly generated by clicking the ditto icon in the top right. 

The original goal of this repo was to build an intelligent style tweaking algorithm and survey users after each visit to measure their thoughts on the automatically generated/tweaked design for the end goal of finalizing visual styling based on machine learning from user feedback. 

The project in its current state is meant to replicate reddit & slightly tweak styles with each change. 

To run the project, clone this repo and run `python template.py` in the cloned folder. Flask is required to run this project.
